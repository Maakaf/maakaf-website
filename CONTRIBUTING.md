## Before Submitting PRs 🚨
All PR's need to pass our Checks in order to be considered.

These include our linting process, our code formatting, and ensuring a successful build.

In order to run a lint locally:

`npm run lint`

In order to format your code:

`npm run format`

In order to build your branch:

`npm run build`

Please be sure to run these steps __before__ opening your PR,

to avoid unnecessary spams in our checks page, and unneeded work for the Github Runners 🏃
